# rest-api-ts

This is a REST API which allows to creat the users, user session & products. Build with [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWUi6BS9T5Y&t=0s) - docker is my addition to make the development process nicer.

Build in express, written in TS, containerized by docker.

## Instruction

Be sure to get the docker up & running on your pc, then in the main dir of the project run this command: `npm run reload`. The script will rebuild the project.
